<meta name="description" content="Downloading input files for OrthoFinder Let’s imagine we want to perform a phylogenomic analysis across a set of species: Dingo (Canis lupus dingo), Great spotted kiwi (Apteryx haastii), Kakapo (Strigops habroptila), Platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), Tammar wallaby (Notamacropus eugenii), and Common wombat (Vombatus ursinus). OrthoFinder requires as input the amino acid sequences for all the protein coding genes in your species of interest. In this section of the tutorial we will discuss how to get these files for the species that you want to analyse. We will cover three major websites for getting this data, Ensembl, NCBI, and Phytozome. Ensembl Recommended if you want to analyse eukaryotic species, especially vertebrates and model organisms. NCBI Recommended if you want to analyse prokaryotic species. Phytozome Recommended if you want to analyse plants. A key consideration when getting input data for OrthoFinder is gene transcripts. When you download the amino acid sequences for a genome, you might have multiple sequences for the same gene. This is because a single gene can produce multiple transcripts, which each might produce a different protein. You can see an example of transcripts in this table of the Actin gene on Ensembl. If we ran OrthoFinder on these raw files it would take much longer than necessary, and could lower the accuracy. We therefore want to extract just the longest transcript variant for each gene. OrthoFinder provides scripts to do this, which we will learn how to use later. Getting data from Ensembl First, we go to the Ensembl webpage with the list of species. You can also use the new beta website, which is updated more regularly. We can then search for our first species (Canis lupus dingo), and click on the link This will take us to the ensembl page for that species On the right hand side under the heading Gene annotation we can press the link to Download FASTA files for the genome. This will take us to a webpage with some folders. We need to click on the pep/ folder, and then click on the file that ends in .pep.all.fa.gz We can then repeat this step for our other species, and place the files that are downloaded into a folder on our computer. I have named my folder Proteomes. The files are stored as .gz compressed files to save space, but we now need to expand the files so that we can access the sequences. You can either double-click on them all, or use the command line gunzip *.gz We’ll use a script provided with OrthoFinder to extract just the longest transcript variant per gene and run OrthoFinder on these files: You can find the script here To run the script, first place it in the Proteomes folder. Then, open the command line and navigate to the Proteomes folder (using cd). You can then use the following command to run the script for f in *fa ; do python primary_transcript.py $f ; done The script will generate a new folder called primary_transcripts, which contains our files. Shortening the filenames is a good idea as it keeps the results tidy as the filenames are used to refer to the species, e.g. I shortened it to Canis_lupus_dingo.fa. Our data is now ready for OrthoFinder. You can go to the ‘Beginner Tutorial’ to see how to run OrthoFinder, or check out the other guides on getting input data from other sources Getting data from NCBI We start by going to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and searching for our first species We want to find the genome of this species, so scroll down to the Genomes section, and click on Assembly / Genome There might be several genomes listed on this page. We are going to click on the one with the green tick, which shows us the reference genome. We can then click the blue Download button, and click the boxes to select the curated RefSeq only annotation, and that we want the GFF and protein FASTA files. We can also give our download a useful name (such as the name of the species). We can then click the Download button, which downloads a zip file. Repeat this step for all of the species that you want to use. For some species in our example list, like the Kiwi, there is no RefSeq genome with protein fasta available. For these species, it is recommended to use Ensembl. Now, we need to deal with the issue of multiple transcripts per gene. For our first species, the Dingo, there are about 20,000 genes. However, if we look at the protein.faa file that we have downloaded, it has about 75,000 sequences. We can use the script ncbi_primary_transcript.py to extract the longest transcript per gene. Place the script in the folder that has the zip folders, and run the following line of code in the command line python ncbi_primary_transcripts.py This will then make a folder named primary_transcripts, which is ready to run Orthofinder on. If you want to download data in bulk, you can also use the NCBI Datasets tool, which can run on the command line. For more info, see here Getting data from Phytozome First, go to the Phytozome data portal website. Here, you can search for a species, such as Oryza sativa You can then find the genome that want to download, and click on it The file that we want ends in primaryTranscriptOnly.fa.gz. Luckily for us, Phytozome already deals with the problem of multiple transcripts. We can select that file, and click Add to Cart. We can then repeat this step for all of the species that we want to download. When we are ready, we then click the shopping cart icon, and press Download on the next page. You will have to sign-in or register to download data. These files can be placed in a folder, where they are now ready to run OrthoFinder." />

    <h3 id="downloading-input-files-for-orthofinder">Downloading input files for OrthoFinder</h3>

<p>Let’s imagine we want to perform a phylogenomic analysis across a set of species:
Dingo (<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Canis lupus dingo</code></em>), Great spotted kiwi (<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Apteryx haastii</code></em>), Kakapo (<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strigops
habroptila</code></em>), Platypus (<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ornithorhynchus anatinus</code></em>), Tammar wallaby (<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Notamacropus
eugenii</code></em>), and Common wombat (<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vombatus ursinus</code></em>).</p>

<p>OrthoFinder requires as input the amino acid sequences for all the protein coding genes
in your species of interest. In this section of the tutorial we will discuss how to get these
files for the species that you want to analyse. We will cover three major websites for
getting this data, Ensembl, NCBI, and Phytozome.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="#getting-data-from-ensembl"><strong>Ensembl</strong></a><br />
Recommended if you want to analyse eukaryotic species, especially
vertebrates and model organisms.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="#getting-data-from-ncbi"><strong>NCBI</strong></a><br />
Recommended if you want to analyse prokaryotic species.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="#getting-data-from-phytozome"><strong>Phytozome</strong></a><br />
Recommended if you want to analyse plants.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A key consideration when getting input data for OrthoFinder is gene transcripts. When you download the amino acid sequences for a genome, you might have multiple
sequences for the same gene. This is because a single gene can produce multiple
transcripts, which each might produce a different protein. You can see an example of
transcripts in this table of the Actin gene on <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Splice?db=core;g=ENSG00000075624;r=7:5527151-5563784">Ensembl</a>.</p>

<p>If we ran OrthoFinder on these raw files it would take much longer than necessary, and
could lower the accuracy. We therefore want to extract just the longest transcript variant for
each gene. OrthoFinder provides scripts to do this, which we will learn how to use later.</p>

<h3 id="getting-data-from-ensembl">Getting data from Ensembl</h3>

<p>First, we go to the <a herf="https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/species.html">Ensembl webpage</a> with the list of species. You can also use the new <a herf="https://beta.ensembl.org/species-selector">beta website</a>, which is updated more regularly.</p>

<p>We can then search for our first species (<em><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Canis lupus dingo</code></em>), and click on the
link This will take us to the ensembl page for that species</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image1.jpeg" alt="input_img1" width="1000" />
</p>

<p>On the right hand side under the heading <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Gene annotation</code> we can press the link to
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download FASTA</code> files for the genome.</p>

<p>This will take us to a webpage with some folders.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image2.png" alt="input_img2" width="600" />
</p>

<p>We need to click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pep/</code> folder, and then click on the file that ends in .pep.all.fa.gz</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image3.jpeg" alt="input_img3" width="600" />
</p>

<p>We can then repeat this step for our other species, and place the files that are
downloaded into a folder on our computer. I have named my folder <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Proteomes</code>.</p>

<p>The files are stored as .gz compressed files to save space, but we now need to expand
the files so that we can access the sequences. You can either double-click on them all,
or use the command line</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">gunzip</span> <span class="k">*</span>.gz
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll use a script provided with OrthoFinder to extract just the longest transcript variant
per gene and run OrthoFinder on these files:</p>

<p>You can find the script <a href="https://github.com/OrthoFinder/OrthoFinder/blob/master/tools/primary_transcript.py">here</a></p>

<p>To run the script, first place it in the Proteomes folder. Then, open the command line
and navigate to the Proteomes folder (using cd). You can then use the following
command to run the script</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">for </span>f <span class="k">in</span> <span class="k">*</span>fa <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do </span>python primary_transcript.py <span class="nv">$f</span> <span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">done</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The script will generate a new folder called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">primary_transcripts</code>, which contains our files.
Shortening the filenames is a good idea as it keeps the results tidy as the filenames are
used to refer to the species, e.g. I shortened it to Canis_lupus_dingo.fa.</p>

<p>Our data is now ready for OrthoFinder. You can go to the ‘Beginner Tutorial’ to see how to run OrthoFinder,
or check out the other guides on getting input data from other sources</p>

<h3 id="getting-data-from-ncbi">Getting data from NCBI</h3>

<p>We start by going to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and searching for our first species</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image4.png" alt="input_img4" width="1000" />
</p>

<p>We want to find the genome of this species, so scroll down to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Genomes</code> section,
and click on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Assembly / Genome</code></p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image5.jpeg" alt="input_img5" width="1000" />
</p>

<p>There might be several genomes listed on this page. We are going to click on the one
with the green tick, which shows us the reference genome.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image6.png" alt="input_img6" width="1000" />
</p>

<p>We can then click the blue <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download</code> button, and click the boxes to select the curated
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RefSeq only</code> annotation, and that we want the GFF and protein FASTA files. We can
also give our download a useful name (such as the name of the species).</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image7.jpeg" alt="input_img7" width="500" />
</p>

<p>We can then click the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download</code> button, which downloads a zip file.</p>

<p>Repeat this step for all of the species that you want to use. For some species in our
example list, like the Kiwi, there is no RefSeq genome with protein fasta available. For
these species, it is recommended to use Ensembl.</p>

<p>Now, we need to deal with the issue of multiple transcripts per gene. For our first
species, the Dingo, there are about 20,000 genes. However, if we look at the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">protein.faa</code> file that we have downloaded, it has about 75,000 sequences.</p>

<p>We can use the script <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ncbi_primary_transcript.py</code> to extract the longest
transcript per gene.</p>

<p>Place the script in the folder that has the zip folders, and run the following line of code in the
command line</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python ncbi_primary_transcripts.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will then make a folder named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">primary_transcripts</code>, which is ready to run
Orthofinder on.</p>

<p>If you want to download data in bulk, you can also use the NCBI Datasets tool, which
can run on the command line. For more info, see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/">here</a></p>

<h3 id="getting-data-from-phytozome">Getting data from Phytozome</h3>

<p>First, go to the <a href="https://data.jgi.doe.gov/">Phytozome data portal website</a>. Here, you can search for a species, such
as Oryza sativa</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image8.jpeg" alt="input_img8" width="800" />
</p>

<p>You can then find the genome that want to download, and click on it</p>

<p>The file that we want ends in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">primaryTranscriptOnly.fa.gz</code>. Luckily for us, Phytozome
already deals with the problem of multiple transcripts. We can select that file, and click
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Add to Cart</code>.</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="/OrthoFinder/assets/images/GettingInput_image9.jpeg" alt="input_img9" width="1000" />
</p>

<p>We can then repeat this step for all of the species that we want to download. When we
are ready, we then click the shopping cart icon, and press <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download</code> on the next page.
You will have to sign-in or register to download data.</p>

<p>These files can be placed in a folder, where they are now ready to run OrthoFinder.</p>
